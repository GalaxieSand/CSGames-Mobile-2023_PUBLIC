# CS Games 2023 - Mobile developpement Competition

## Context

The creation of underwater cities presents a new opportunity to reimagine how residents recieve information on their enviornement. With the goals of transparency, communication and independance, the universities commitee wants to create an application that can provide information to the residents of the underwater cities.

## General overview

The unviersities commitee has mandated that your team develop a **.NET MAUI** mobile application to provide general information to residents that can assist them in their day to day activities. Specifically, the commitee would like the following information to be provided to residents : Transit schedule, local and earth wide news, temperature (water and internal), air quality, water quality and the cities power levels. Furthermore, they would like the users to recieve alerts if ever various environmental factors become a concern for their safety. Finally they would also like a feature the allows users to call for help from the application if needed.

## Technical information

A web server with an API is already in place to allow you to get the required information to display in the application
